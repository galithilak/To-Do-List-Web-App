Project Description:
Create a simple to-do list web application with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Users should be able to add tasks, mark them as completed, edit task details, and delete tasks. The application should store the tasks on the server side, allowing users to access their to-do list from any device.

Technologies:

Backend: Choose a backend language and framework you're comfortable with. Popular options include:

Node.js with Express
Python with Flask
Ruby on Rails
Database: Use a lightweight database for storing the tasks, such as SQLite for simplicity.

Frontend: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. You can also consider using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js, but it's not necessary for this beginner project.

Features to Implement:

Display a list of tasks with options to mark tasks as completed, edit task details, and delete tasks.
Add a new task with a title and optional description.
Mark tasks as completed, and provide a visual indication for completed tasks.
Edit task details, such as the title or description.
Delete tasks from the to-do list.
Optional Features (for enhancement):

Add due dates to tasks and display them in order of urgency.
User authentication: Allow users to create accounts and have personalized to-do lists.
Task categories or labels: Allow users to categorize tasks into different groups (e.g., Work, Personal, Shopping).
Search and filtering: Enable users to search for tasks or filter tasks based on different criteria.
Learning Opportunities:
This project will give you hands-on experience with building a basic backend API, handling data storage with a database, and connecting the frontend to the backend using HTTP requests. Additionally, you'll get familiar with concepts like CRUD operations, routing, and working with data in a web application.

Sure! Below is a basic file structure for the "To-Do List Web App" project using Node.js with Express as the backend and a simple frontend without any frontend framework:

Explanation:

backend/: This directory contains all the backend code using Node.js and Express.

node_modules/: This is where all the dependencies of the backend will be installed when you run npm install.

controllers/: This directory contains the controllers for the tasks. These controllers will handle the logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

models/: This directory contains the Task model, which represents the data structure of a task and will be used to interact with the database.

routes/: This directory contains the taskRoutes, which define the API routes for handling CRUD operations on tasks.

app.js: This is the main file of the backend, where you set up the Express app, middleware, and API routes.

package.json and package-lock.json: These files keep track of the project's dependencies and metadata.

frontend/: This directory contains the frontend code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

index.html: The main HTML file for the application.

css/: This directory contains the styles for the application.

js/: This directory contains the JavaScript code.

database/: This directory contains the SQLite database file where the tasks will be stored.
